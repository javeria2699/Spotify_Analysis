##Project Overview
This project analyzes Spotify track and album data using SQL. By performing various SQL queries, we extract meaningful insights on track performance, artist trends, and key metrics such as energy, danceability, and streams. The project applies both basic and advanced SQL techniques to uncover deeper insights from the dataset.
